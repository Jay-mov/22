        <h1><strong>Return</strong></h1>
        <p>A few months after the break up, someone I know told me, "If they truly love you, they'll come back". Guy was right. The dude was going through a messy divorce and his wife literally always came back. At the time I was like, damn she didn't love me. I was 50/50 unsure that you'd return. Happy you did though.</p>

    <div class="container"> 
        <h1><strong>One day</strong></h1>
        <p>Perhaps one day we'll be together again... or not. I think a relationship is something that no one needs but wants and to want something is to fight for it, to like it. Why am I updating this knowing you'll probably never read this. Hope is what keeps me going. Its dangerous, it can make you or it can break you.<br>
        I'm still working on me and I'm coming back better for you. I wanna take the weight off your shoulders too.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container"> 
        <h1><strong>A day</strong></h1>
        <p>I feel like I have an obligation to update this. I still think that you do come back and check this. Stupid of me. Sucks that I can't let go. How can I? <br> 
        We've both expressed love for each other and we support each other...right? You said that you aren't ready for a relationship and I told you that I know what to do this time around, and that's very much true. You are beautiful, pretty, something worth spending time just admiring. It sucks that I fell in love with someone so unique and rare because you are truly one of a kind. No one else compares to you, can't even come close. To find someone else like you is next to or is impossible. <br>
        I'm proud that you built a life for yourself, I'm so happy for you. I'm very grateful to have known someone like you <br>
        I still very much deeply love you. </p>

        <p>As I'm writing this, things may not be rainbows and sunshine<br>
            ik you're prolly tired of me and i wanna say sorry. I'm sorry for everything<br>
            i did to you. I really dont want you to change into someone i dont recognize <br>
            I love the old you, the person I met in 2017 at the hotel</p>

        <h1><strong>November 21, 2024</strong></h1>
        <p>This is an update right before releasing it to you. I just wanna say that I'm happy that I was able
            to give you the flowers that so long dreamt of. Initially I wasn't gonna get you flowers but i figured
            you deserved the best so i tried. I also thought i wouldn't be able to get you it because I'm too shy.
            I was afraid that I was gonna let you down again and im happy that i didnt. I hope to do better next year.
        </p>
