        <p>As I'm writing this, things may not be rainbows and sunshine<br>
            ik you're prolly tired of me and i wanna say sorry. I'm sorry for everything<br>
            i did to you. I really dont want you to change into someone i dont recognize <br>
            I love the old you, the person I met in 2017 at the hotel</p>

        <h1><strong>November 21, 2024</strong></h1>
        <p>This is an update right before releasing it to you. I just wanna say that I'm happy that I was able
            to give you the flowers that so long dreamt of. Initially I wasn't gonna get you flowers but i figured
            you deserved the best so i tried. I also thought i wouldn't be able to get you it because I'm too shy.
            I was afraid that I was gonna let you down again and im happy that i didnt. I hope to do better next year.
        </p>
        <p style="color: purple;">I love you </p>
